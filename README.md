# DAppalytics

Dappalytics shows analytics for Smart Contracts on Ethereum.

In the future this app will show Analytics (analytics like in google analytics jusr for DApps), but currently app's current focus is creating relevant metrics for analyzing ICO's. The first set of metrics that needs to be developed:

>Metric that sort accounts which invested in particular ICO by time account was created.

>Account sort by the number of ETH coins owned, that participated in ICO.

>A number of sent and received ETH coins on ICO's Smart Contract at a certain amount of time.

>The number of transactions per time period.

>ICO asset value.

>Metric that compares two or more ICO's and shows:

>Percentage of identical accounts participating
>Their token investment compared to total amount of tokens
>Top n accounts
